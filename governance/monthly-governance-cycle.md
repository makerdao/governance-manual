# Monthly Governance Cycle

The Monthly Governance Cycle is defined in [MIP51](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51) and provides a predictable monthly cadence by which governance decisions are made.

The Monthly Governance Cycle is predominantly used for the introduction of new MIPs or MIP subproposals into the Maker Protocol. Examples of such changes could include:
* The addition of a new Core Unit to the Maker Protocol
* The adjustment of an existing Core Unit's operating budget

Proposals submitted into the Monthly Governance Cycle must follow the guidelines defined in [MIP0](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP0).

## Governance Cycle Breakdown ([MIP51c1](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51#MIP51c1))

The first Monday of each calendar month marks the beginning of the Monthly Governance Cycle.

### Week 1

**Week 1, Monday through Wednesday**
-   MIP Authors move their proposals to **Formal Submission**. This phase lasts for 3 days.
-   Proposals must be moved into the [formal submission](https://forum.makerdao.com/c/mips/fs/16) subcategory on the MakerDAO forums under the [Maker Improvement Proposal](https://forum.makerdao.com/c/mips/14) category.
-   MIP Authors should inform MIP Editors of the status change via commonly used communications channels.

**Week 1, Thursday**
-  Governance Facilitators perform the **Submission Review** as part of the weekly Governance and Risk meeting and communicate which of the proposed MIPs are in accordance with guidelines (defined in the MIP0 Framework). MIPs that meet the guidelines will continue to the Ratification Poll stage.
- The Governance Facilitators must come to consensus on whether each submission should move forward to a Ratification Poll.
    - Governance Facilitators may consider blocking a proposal if they believe that moving forward to a Ratification Poll would negatively affect community cohesion.
        - If the Governance Facilitators prevent a proposal from moving to a Ratification Poll, they must clearly communicate their reasons for doing so via the official [forum](https://forum.makerdao.com).
        - In the event the Governance Facilitators abuse this power **they should be removed from their positions via any method Maker Governance determines is appropriate**.

### Week 2

**Week 2, Monday**
-   The Governance Facilitators publish the set of **Ratification Polls**. The format of these is defined in [MIP51c2](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51#MIP51c2).
-   Ratification Polls are published to the [community GitHub](https://github.com/makerdao/community/tree/master/governance/polls), submitted on-chain and appear on the official [voting portal](https://vote.makerdao.com/).
-   Ratification Polls will run for two weeks.

### Week 4

**Week 4, Monday**
-   The Ratification polls conclude, and each proposal or set of proposals is marked as either Accepted or Rejected by the MIP Editors.

**Week 4, Thursday**
- The Governance Facilitators do a **Governance Cycle Review** as part of the weekly Governance and Risk meeting in which they summarize and discuss the Governance Cycle with the community.
- The Governance Facilitators also discuss the upcoming Governance Cycle and potential submissions with the community.
