# Impact Estimations

GovAlpha applies impact estimations to active governance items (MIPs and Signal Requests). The goal of these estimations is to:

* Provide delegates, core unit members and the wider community with an idea of how important it is that they pay attention to a given governance item given limited time.
* Provide appropriate context for GovAlpha members conducting internal reviews of governance items.

Impact estimations currently have a single dimension, giving GovAlpha’s estimate on the magnitude of the impact a given governance item will have on the Maker Protocol and MakerDAO. A `low`, `medium`, or `high` impact score will be assigned to active governance items.

## Guidelines

The following guidelines will be used when creating estimations.

**Likely High Impact**
* Anything that adds or removes concretely identifiable risk to the Maker Protocol will likely be marked as `high` impact.
* Anything the DAO is doing for the first time is likely to be marked as `high` impact.
* Anything that adds or removes a non-trivial amount of DAI from the surplus buffer will likely be marked as `high` impact.
* Core Unit onboarding and offboarding will likely be marked as `high` impact.
* Anything that permanently changes governance processes or structures within MakerDAO will likely be marked as `high` impact.

**Likely Medium Impact**
* Items that may lead to later decisions that add or remove risk and/or add or remove a non-trivial amount of DAI from the surplus buffer will likely be marked as `medium` impact.
* Anything that adds or removes a trivial amount of money from the surplus buffer will likely be marked as `medium` impact.

**Likely Low Impact**
* Minor wording changes and/or fixes to existing MIPs will likely be marked as `low` impact.

If there is any doubt about a given estimation, it will generally be rounded up.


## Usage

GovAlpha will add impact estimation tags in the following places:
* [Governance tracker spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LWNlv6hr8oXebk8rvXZBPRVDjN-3OrzI0IgLwBVk0vM/edit#gid=0).
