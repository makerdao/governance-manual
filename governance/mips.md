# MIPs 

## What is a MIP?

A Maker Improvement Proposal (MIP) is a document that regulates and defines the behavior of Maker Governance, MakerDAO, or the Maker Protocol. They are standardized documents voted upon by Maker Governance. MIPs can be amended and removed.

The [Maker Improvement Proposal Framework (MIP0)](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP0) defines the Maker Improvement Proposals (MIPs) Framework for all subsequent MIPs to utilize.

## Historical Aside and Current State

The MIP Framework (a once large and ever-growing pool of 100+ documents) has been the legislative backbone of MakerDAO since April 2020. In view of recent changes introduced by the Endgame (which affect the framework both in regards to content and operation), a brief review of them is in order:

- A large batch of MIPs has been deprecated.
- The MIP Framework has been relatively locked in place, with no new MIPs allowed in addition to the 17 that are still active. These MIPs are transitionally known as Endgame MIPs.
- Out of the 17 Endgame MIPs, some are due to be deprecated as the Endgame further establishes itself.

## List of MIPs

The MIP Framework currently comprises 17 MIPs, out of which five have been set to be deprecated as the Endgame further establishes itself. MIPs with no scheduled deprecation are expected to remain as the core and only MIPs.
