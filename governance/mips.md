# MIPs 

## What is a MIP?

A Maker Improvement Proposal (MIP) is a document that regulates and defines the behavior of Maker Governance, MakerDAO, or the Maker Protocol. They are standardized documents voted upon by Maker Governance. MIPs can be amended and removed.

The [Maker Improvement Proposal Framework (MIP0)](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP0) defines the Maker Improvement Proposals (MIPs) Framework for all subsequent MIPs to utilize.

## Current State

The MIP Framework currently consists of 17 MIPs. Recent changes introduced by [the Endgame](https://endgame.makerdao.com/endgame/overview) have deprecated a large batch of MIPs (hence the seemingly haphazard numbering) and locked the framework in place by disallowing the creation of new MIPs. However, the existing MIPs can be amended.

## List of MIPs

The MIP Framework currently comprises 17 MIPs, out of which five (marked with an asterisk) have been set to be deprecated.
