# MIPs 

## What is a MIP?

A Maker Improvement Proposal (MIP) is a document that regulates and defines the behavior of the Maker Governance and the Maker Protocol. They are standardized documents voted upon by the Maker Community. MIPs can be added, amended, replaced, and removed.

The [Maker Improvement Proposal Framework (MIP0)](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP0) defines the Maker Improvement Proposals (MIPs) Framework for all subsequent MIPs to utilize.

Of particular note are the Core Principles (defined in MIP0) that MIPs should be written to follow. These are:

**Specificity:** A MIP must define and address a specific behavior or single responsibility. Overburdened MIPs are not allowed.  

**Completeness:** A MIP must be thorough. Relevant, specific particulars must not be left undefined or unreferenced.  

**Avoid overlap:** Multiple MIPs must not implement the same type of behavior independently. For instance, there should not be two separate, interchangeable ways to onboard collaterals.  

**Clarity:** A MIP must not have equally valid conflicting interpretations. A MIP must be as clear and easy to understand as possible.  

**Brevity:** A MIP must be as short as possible, including only what is essential given the other core principles.  

## Key MIPs

Here are the MIPs that are essential to the process of understanding and participating in Governance.

### [MIP0: Maker Improvement Proposal Framework](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP0)
MIP0 defines the Maker Improvement Proposals (MIPs) Framework for all subsequent MIPs to utilize.

### [MIP4: MIP Amendment and Renewal process](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP4)
MIP4 defines processes for the amendment and removal of accepted MIPs.

### [MIP16: The Weekly Governance Cycle](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP16)
MIP16 defines and formalizes the Weekly Governance Cycle to provide a more predictable weekly framework for Maker governance decisions.

### [MIP51: Monthly Governance Cycle](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51)
MIP51 defines a monthly Governance Cycle that provides a predictable framework for Maker governance decisions.

### [MIP24: Emergency Response](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP24)
MIP24 defines emergency and urgent situations for the Maker protocol, as well as the process for handling them.

### [The Core Unit Framework MIP Set](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/list?mipsetMode=true)
The Core Unit Framework MIP Set is a set of MIPs that defines the structure of Core Units. It includes:
- [MIP38 - DAO Primitives States](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP38): a MIP that keeps track of all the states related to Core Units, Budgets and Facilitators.
- [MIP39 - Core Unit Framework](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP39): contains a framework for managing Core Units and modifying them in the DAO Primitives State MIP.
- [MIP40 - Budget Framework](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP40): contains a framework for managing budgets and modifying them in the DAO Primitives State MIP.
- [MIP41 - Facilitator Framework](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP41): contains a framework for managing Facilitators and modifying them in the DAO Primitives State MIP.

### [MIP6: Collateral Onboarding Application](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP6)
MIP6 defines a standardized application form used to kick off the process of onboarding a new collateral asset to the Maker Protocol.

### [MIP13: Declaration of Intent](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP13)
MIP13 introduces declarations of intent, which allow Maker Governance to signal an intention to the wider community.
