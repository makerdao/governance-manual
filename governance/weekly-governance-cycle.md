# The Weekly Governance Cycle

The Weekly Governance Cycle is formalized by [MIP16](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP16) and provides a predictable weekly framework for Maker Governance decisions.

The Weekly Governance Cycle works in conjunction with the Monthly Governance Cycle ([MIP51](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51)). It permits recurring decisions to be made that require quicker action than is allowed by the Monthly Governance Cycle.

### Weekly Governance Cycle Definitions ([MIP16c1](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP16#MIP16c1)) 

- A **Weekly Poll** is a non-binding Governance Poll that determines the weekly Executive Vote contents. Weekly Polls cannot change system parameters independently; they merely dictate what will be included in the next Executive Vote.
- A **Non-Standard Weekly Poll** is a non-binding Weekly Poll that contains arbitrary time-sensitive decisions. These polls need to be expedited through the Maker governance process via a separate vote. The use of Non-Standard Weekly Polls is exclusive to Facilitators, given that they have already established a high level of trust with the community. The use of Non-Standard Weekly Polls is limited to situations where the Weekly Governance Cycle is determined to operate too slowly to be usable. An example of such a poll might be the Risk Core Unit ([RISK-001](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP39c2SP2)) Facilitator proposing urgent parameter changes for a collateral type due to an abrupt change in market conditions, or a vulnerability that has been detected.
- Ratified Facilitators (a list can be found [here](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP38#MIP38c2)) are authorized by Maker Governance to interact with the Weekly Cycle. Facilitators may submit Non-Standard Weekly Polls that are related to their Core Unit Mandate. If necessary, and if it is related to their Core Unit Mandate, Facilitators can skip the Non-Standard Weekly Polls and include logic directly into the weekly Executive Vote.
