# Scopes and Scope Artifacts

{% hint style="warning" %} This documentation describes ongoing changes in functionality and processes. Be aware that parts may be inaccurate or out of date. {% endhint %}

## Overview

A Scope is a broad area of focus for products, protocol-related work, and/or governance in MakerDAO. All work done within the Maker Ecosystem must fall under one of the five Scopes.

Every Scope has a Scope Bounded Mutable Aligment Artifact, also referred to as Scope Artifact. These are frameworks that contain the rules for all work, governance, and other processes that take place under that Scope. Scope Artifacts can be amended through [MIP102c2 subproposals](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP102#MIP102c2).

## Modification of Scope Artifact

Scope Artifacts are modifiable within the constraints of Scope Boundaries that are immutably defined in the Maker Atlas.
Scope Artifacts include *strengthening elements*, which ossify over time, and *mutable elements*, which are elements related to governance, budget elements, and template elements that may require regular updates.

Scope Artifacts must include a ruleset for the ossification of mutable elements. Any **significant** change to the Scopes should take long and should allow enough time for feedback.

Any change made to a Scope Artifact must aim to improve one or more of the following desirable features of the Maker Ecosystem.
- Decentralization
- Autonomous operation
- Future-proofing
- Resilience
- Clarity of instructions
- Simplicity of protocol

## Governance

Each Scope has a [Scope Advisory Council](scope-advisory-councils.md).  Councils carry out advisory work related to improving the content of the Scope Artifacts. Councils consist of members who must fulfill certain requirements and have been approved by Maker Governance.

## List of Scopes

The Maker Protocol has five Scopes. They are:

1. **Governance (GOV):** Codifies rules that regulate the critical balance of power processes defined in the Maker Atlas, and adjudicate on appeals processes related to misalignment in the ecosystem.
2. **Support (SUP):** Codifies rules that regulate various tasks of ecosystem support, including governance process infrastructure and management, SubDAO ecosystem support, Public Good Purpose System.
3. **Protocol (PRO):** Codifies rules related to the core technical MakerDAO protocol.
4. **Stability (STA)** Codifies the rules related to managing the core stablecoin product, Dai, and supporting factors related to financial stability, such as surplus buffer and decentralized asset reserve.
5. **Accessibility (ACC):** Codifies rules related to accessibility and distribution efforts, and regulates user-facing frontends of MakerDAO Core and SubDAOs.
