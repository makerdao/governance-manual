# MIPs 

## What is a MIP?

- A Maker Improvement Proposal (MIP) is a document that regulates and defines the behavior of the Maker Governance and the Maker Protocol. They are standarized documents voted upon by the Maker Community. MIPs can be added, amended, replaced, and removed.
- The [Maker Improvement Proposal Framework (MIP0)](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP0) defines the Maker Improvement Proposals (MIPs) Framework for all subsequent MIPs to utilize.

- MIP0c2: Core Principles
	- Specificity: A MIP must define and address a specific behavior or single responsibility. Overburdened MIPs are not allowed.
	- Completeness: A MIP must be thorough. Relevant, specific particulars must not be left undefined or unreferenced.
	- Avoid overlap: Multiple MIPs must not implement the same type of behavior independently. For instance, there should not be two separate, interchangeable ways to onboard collaterals.
	- Clarity: A MIP must not have equally valid conflicting interpretations. A MIP must be as clear and easy to understand as possible.
	- Brevity: A MIP must be as short as possible, including only what is essential given the other core principles.

## Key MIPs

- Here are the MIPs that are essential to the process of understanding and participating in Governance.

[MIP13: Declaration of Intent](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP13)

- MIP13 introduces declarations of intent, which allow Maker Governance to signal an intention to the wider community.

[MIP15: Dark Spell mechanism](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP15)

- MIP15 proposes a process for applying critical bug fixes to the Maker Protocol.

[MIP16: The Weekly Governance Cycle](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP16)

[MIP24: Emergency Response](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP24)

- MIP24 defines emergency and urgent situations for the Maker protocol, as well as the process for handling them.

[The Core Unit Framework MIP Set](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/list?mipsetMode=true) is a set of MIPs that defines and structures Core Units. It includes:

- [MIP38 - DAO Primitives States](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP38): is a MIP that keeps track of all the states related to Core Units, Budgets and Facilitators.
- [MIP39 - Core Unit Framework](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP39): contains a framework for managing Core Units and modifying them in the DAO Primitives State MIP.
- [MIP40 - Budget Framework](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP40): contains a framework for managing budgets and modifying them in the DAO Primitives State MIP.
- [MIP41 - Facilitator Framework](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP41): contains a framework with subproposal processes for managing Facilitators and modifying them in the DAO Primitives State MIP.

[MIP51: Monthly Governance Cycle](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP51)

- MIP51 defines a monthly Governance Cycle that provides a predictable framework for Maker governance decisions.
