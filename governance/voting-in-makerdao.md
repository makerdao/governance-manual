# Introduction to voting in MakerDAO
MakerDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization whose governance process controls various aspects of the Maker Protocol. On-chain voting requires MKR tokens. MKR holders have the sole authority to enact changes to the system through voting. 

Voting is calculated by a weighted voting system, where voting power is proportional to the amount of MKR tokens cast. For example, if 50 stakeholders hold a total of 600 MKR and vote for proposal A, while 100 stakeholders hold a total of 400 MKR and vote for proposal B, then Proposal A would win with 60% of the vote. The number of stakeholders who voted for a proposal does not change the result.

Off-chain voting takes place on the [Maker Forum](https://forum.makerdao.com) and on-chain voting takes place on the [Governance Portal](https://vote.makerdao.com/).
