# Core Unit Section

## What is a Core Unit?

Core Units are the basic workforce divisions that Maker Governance can oversee, manage and prioritize. Each Core Unit has a long-term work area assigned to it that covers a broad set of responsibilities or focus. Core Units can be proposed by anyone; their inclusion in MakerDAO is voted on by Maker Governance.

Each active Core Unit consists of at least three active subproposals (i.e., subproposals that have not been superseded by other subproposals): a *mandate* subproposal (see [MIP39](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP39)) that lays out the objectives and directions that a given Core Unit is responsible for fulfilling. Executing these objectives usually requires funding, which is requested via *budget* subproposals (see [MIP40](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP40)). *Facilitator* subproposals (see [MIP41](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP41)) establish individuals as official points of contact and parties responsible for the Core Unit fulfilling its mandate.

> The concept of Core Unit is defined in a MIP Set called *The Core Unit Operating Model*, also known as the *The Core Unit Framework*. This MIP Set comprises [MIP38](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP38), [MIP39](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP39), [MIP40](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP40), and [MIP41](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP41); jointly, these MIPs define the abstract Core Unit structure.

### Mandate

Core Unit Mandates set the objectives and direction of the work that the Core Unit must strive for.

Mandates aim to be broad, open-ended, and high-level documents that provide space for innovation and flexibility on behalf of the Core Unit Facilitators. They can be regarded as "questions" for Facilitators to "answer" within their Facilitator Commitment proposal.

Mandates from different Core Units can overlap to create redundancy. This helps to parallelize and decentralize work within the DAO - allowing it to scale effectively and resiliently.

### Budget

Budgets are used to fund a core unit in their effort to fulfill their given mandate. A budget is attached to a Core Unit and is meant to be used only for that Core Unit. The Facilitators of each Core Unit administer Core Unit budgets and must ensure that transparency and accountability exist as the budget is spent.

The [Budget Framework (MIP40)](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP40) contains a framework for Maker Governance to manage and evaluate Core Unit's budgets in a transparent and standardized way.

Facilitators have the flexibility to modify their plans away from the initially submitted budget breakdown if they deem it appropriate - though they cannot exceed the total amount budgeted without a further Governance Vote. 

The components of a Core Unit Budget proposal are:
- **Budget Breakdown**: It consists of the Core Unit Facilitators' best guess breakdown of spending for their Core Unit during the budget period.
- **Budget Implementation**: It defines when and how the Core Unit Facilitators will receive the funds that make up their budget.

### Facilitator(s)

A Facilitator is the most trusted actor in the MakerDAO community. They are given a high degree of autonomy and resources with which to achieve their mandated goals. 

Additionally, Facilitators of a Core Unit can expedite specific Governance Processes when the contents of a given proposal can be related to their Mandate. Further, they may be given additional permissions over the Maker Protocol at the discretion of Maker Governance.

The [Facilitator Framework (MIP41)](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP41) provides Governance with a simple way of managing and holding Facilitators accountable through the MIPs process.

## Tracking existing Core Units

The [DAO Primitives State (MIP38)](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP38) allows users to track the currently active Core Units.

## Submission Process: How do we propose a Core Unit?

The process of proposing a new Core Unit or modifying an existing one is explained on [MIP39c2:Adding/Modifying Core Units (Subproposal Process)](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP39#MIP39c2).

The process for removing Core Units is explained on [MIP39c3: Removing Core Units (Subproposal Process)](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP39#MIP39c3).
