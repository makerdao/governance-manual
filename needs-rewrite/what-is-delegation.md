# What is Delegation?

Delegation is a mechanism through which MKR Holders can entrust their voting power to one or more chosen delegates. These delegates can then vote using the MKR delegated to them. Delegates have no ability to access the MKR delegated to them directly.

MKR Holders are always able to vote on proposals directly if they do not wish to delegate their MKR tokens.

MakerDAO has two varieties of delegates.

## Recognized Delegates
Recognized Delegates are whitelisted by the Governance Facilitators of MakerDAO. They must meet requirements for consistent participation in votes, and communication with the community.

In exchange for meeting these requirements, Recognized Delegates are compensated in DAI and are featured more prominently on voting frontends.

Recognized Delegates act as a bridge between vote outcomes and other actors by actively and transparently communicating with the MakerDAO community.

## Shadow Delegates
Shadow Delegates are permissionless, with no requirements or responsibilities beyond those they have agreed on directly with holders who delegate to them.
