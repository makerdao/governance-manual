## Description

The `Debt Auction Delay`, or wait parameter, defines how much time must pass after a Vault has been liquidated before any corresponding debt is marked as bad debt.

If a corresponding `Flip` auction does not clear the debt and any associated penalty fees within the `Debt Auction Delay`, the remaining debt will be considered bad debt. Initially, the Surplus Buffer will cover the bad debt, but if the system accrues enough bad debt to exhaust the Surplus Buffer, the system will trigger a `Flop` auction where MKR is minted and sold to cover the balance.

For example, if the `Debt Auction Delay` is set to 2 hours, once a Vault is liquidated, Keepers have 2 hours to bid and cover the debt before the Vaultâ€™s debt is considered bad debt.

## Purpose

The `Debt Auction Delay` exists to provide time for Keepers to bid on liquidated Vaults via `Flip` auctions. If the `Debt Auction Delay` is set to 0, all liquidations will proceed instantly to `Flop` auctions, which would mint unnecessary amounts of MKR.

The `Debt Auction Delay` is one of several parameters Maker Governance can utilize to adjust how auctions function in response to protocol risk and market conditions. For example, there may be circumstances where it is desirable to either increase or decrease the speed at which debt is transferred to `Flop` auctions, and the `Debt Auction Delay` facilitates this.

## Trade-offs

It is essential to recognize the interaction between `Flip` and `Flop` auctions in the context of the `Debt Auction Delay`.

If the `Debt Auction Delay` is set too low, the system may prematurely commence a `Flop` auction before the corresponding `Flip` auction has been completed. For example, this can occur if the `Debt Auction Delay` is set to a lower value than the Max Auction Duration of `Flip` auctions. In this situation, it is conceivable that Keepers might cover outstanding debt within the remaining time, and the `Flop` auction is therefore unnecessary. This scenario could lead to excess MKR being minted or the Surplus Buffer being drained.

If the `Debt Auction Delay` is set too high, then it will prevent `Flop` auctions from occurring. This will lead to undercollateralized DAI and downwards pressure on the Peg.

## Changes

Adjusting the `Debt Auction Delay` is a manual process that requires an executive vote. Changes to the `Debt Auction Delay` are subject to the GSM Pause Delay.

**Why increase this parameter?**

`Debt Auction Delay` should be increased if the Max Auction Duration of `Flip` auctions is increased to prevent unnecessary `Flop` auctions.

**Why decrease this parameter?**

The `Debt Auction Delay` might be decreased if it is felt that it is taking too long for `Flop` auctions to commence, leaving the system undercollateralized.

## Considerations

Given that `Flop` auctions can occur before the corresponding `Flip` auction has been completed, it is wise to ensure that `Debt Auction Delay > Max Auction Duration` to allow `Flip` auctions time to complete.

In Emergency Shutdown, all `Flop` auctions are cancelled, and the `Debt Auction Delay` is therefore nullified.
