# Delegates Code of Conduct

## Good Faith

Delegates should act at all times with honesty, integrity, and transparency.

## Best Interest

Delegates should operate and vote in what they believe is in the best interests of the Maker Protocol.

## Due Care and Attention

Delegates should make a professional and unbiased review of each proposal prior to the submission of their vote.

## Communication

Delegates should ensure that they communicate the rationale behind each of their votes in a clear and accessible way.

## Professional Knowledge

Delegates should maintain a working knowledge of developments at Maker and in the wider cryptocurrency space.

## Conflicts of Interest

Delegates should avoid conflicts of interest where possible and mitigate their impact when not possible. Disclose in writing any conflicts. Publicize any offer of external compensation related to delegation or the Maker Protocol.

## Availability

Delegates should - within reason - be accessible to the community to answer questions, respond to comments, and discuss issues.

## End of Delegation

Delegates should communicate their intention to stop being a delegate at least a month in advance to allow any MKR holders delegating to them an opportunity to move their MKR to another delegate.
