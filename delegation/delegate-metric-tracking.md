# Delegate Metric Tracking

The GovAlpha Core Unit (GOV-001) tracks metrics relating to the voting activities of Recognized Delegates. These are useful to both current and prospective delegators in gauging how active and consistent Recognized Delegates have been. The metrics currently tracked for Recognized Delegates centre on participation in on-chain voting and communication by Recognized Delegates regarding their voting choices.

These metrics can be seen on the delegate cards on the [voting portal](https://vote.makerdao.com/delegates). In addition, a further breakdown of each Recognized Delegate's participation metric is available on their [metric pages](https://vote.makerdao.com/delegates) on the voting portal - here is an example of what a metric page looks like.

## Participation Metric

For Participation, a score of 100% would mean that a Delegate has voted in all possible polls over the shorter of 1) the previous 120 days, or 2) since becoming a Recognized Delegate. GovAlpha tracks Participation in Governance Polls and Executive Polls separately, then combines them to form an overall participation rating.

Note that if Recognized Delegates choose not to support an Executive Vote and communicate this clearly, this will be counted as participating in the relevant Executive Vote. This is because there is no option to vote "No" to an Executive Vote.

## Communication Metrics

For Communication, GovAlpha tracks how Recognized Delegates have communicated their votes. Recognized Delegates are rewarded with a higher score for providing the reasoning behind their voting decisions.

For example, a score of 100% would mean a Recognized Delegate communicated all of their voting decisions AND gave reasons for reaching these decisions over the shorter of 1) the previous 120 days, or 2) since becoming a Recognized Delegate.  On the other hand, a score of 50% would indicate a Delegate communicated their decisions but did not provide any reasoning for these decisions. Their scores for each vote are combined to give an overall communication rating.

## Spreadsheet

GovAlpha maintains a publicly accessible spreadsheet that tracks Recognized Delegate metrics. This can be seen [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E-VBZFN_N7cj60-wMze2yR1fBDWVs_QoPn-aS5Y-1pM/edit#gid=1415939965).
