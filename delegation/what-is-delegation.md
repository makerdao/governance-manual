# What is Delegation?

- Delegation is the mechanism through which MKR holders can entrust MKR and their voting power to assigned delegates.
- MakerDAO will have two varieties of delegates:
	- Recognised Delegates are whitelisted and must meet specific requirements in exchange for more visibility and prestige.
	- Shadow Delegates are permissionless, with no requirements or responsibilities beyond those they have agreed on directly with holders who delegate to them.
- Recognised Delegates act as a bridge between vote outcomes and other actors by actively and transparently communicating with the MakerDAO community.
- Delegation in Maker was soft-launched on August 2nd, 2021. The hard launch will be accompanied by a community marketing push and will occur once additional criteria are met.
- MKR holders will continue to be able to vote on proposals directly if they do not wish to delegate their tokens.
