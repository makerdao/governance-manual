# How to Attract More Delegate MKR as a MakerDAO Recognized Delegate

Recognized Delegates in the Maker Protocol may wish to attract MKR holders to delegate to them to increase their voting power, and potentially, their financial rewards from the Maker Protocol. Ultimately, Recognized Delegates are responsible for making themselves an attractive option for MKR holders to delegate their MKR.

Below are some potential avenues that can be used to attract more delegated MKR from MKR holders. Please note this is not an exhaustive list.

* Engagement on the [MakerDAO forum](https://forum.makerdao.com/) can enable MKR holders to form an understanding of a Recognized Delegate's positions on various topics. Thorough communication of voting stances will potentially attract like-minded MKR holders to delegate their MKR.
* Participation in public calls, such as the Governance and Risk Call will likewise provide a platform for Recognized Delegates to share their views and opinions.
* Several Recognized Delegates have reached out on various Reddit communities in order to encourage MKR holders to delegate to them, specifically around more controversial issues that affect the Maker Protocol. Examples of communities that may be useful for this approach include:
    * [r/makerdao](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/)
    * [r/ethfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/)
    * [r/ethtrader](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/)
    * [r/cryptocurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrency/)
* Other social media platforms may also allow Recognized Delegates to connect with some MKR holders. [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) may be a particularly good platform for this kind of activity.
* Some large token holders have delegate programs that Recognized Delegates can approach to try to source more voting power. Alternatively, Delegates may wish to directly approach known holders of large amounts of MKR to encourage them to delegate.
* Consider campaigning on issues that are not represented among other Recognized Delegates, i.e. where a consensus opinion has formed among other Recognized Delegates, adopting an anti- or pro- stance may encourage MKR holders to delegate their MKR.
* Consider under-represented groups or geographical regions and appeal to users located within those groups.
