# Separation of Powers and Delegation

## Core Unit Members as Recognized Delegates

As separate and distinct groups, Recognized Delegates and Core Units are a check on each other's power over the Maker Protocol.
* **Recognized Delegates** can propose and collectively vote on any change that they want, but they require Core Units to execute a change safely.
* **Core Units** can put any change to the Maker Protocol that they want up for a vote, but they require Recognized Delegates to vote through any change before it can affect the Maker Protocol.

Each group has slightly different incentives, which when competing should benefit the Maker Protocol as a whole.
* **Core Unit** members generally own MKR Tokens, but they also receive salaries in DAI from the Maker Protocol. Their primary incentive is stability in employment and larger budgets (leading to increased salaries or perceived importance.)
* **Recognized Delegates** may or may not own MKR Tokens. Recognized Delegates receive remuneration in DAI based on how consistently and effectively they vote, and how much MKR they can attract. Their primary incentive is to attract more MKR to their platform.

Overlapping these groups may lead to issues in the longer term as this separation is eroded. In the worst case, a complete overlap of the two groups means that a single collection of entities with similar if not identical incentives is responsible for both implementing and ratifying changes.

Here are some examples of some negative outcomes that could result from the combination of Core Units and Recognized Delegates:
* Core Units proposing and approving their own budgets - (no need to satisfy an outside stakeholder)
* Recognized Delegates constructing and approving their own remuneration - (can break the connection between MKR delegated).
* Reduction of transparency to the community and MKR Holders - (no need to be transparent outside the in-group if you have the power to both make and pass changes)
* Core Units with attached Recognized Delegates receiving a disproportionate amount of budget relative to those without representation - (directing funds to your in-group versus where they are best used)
* Centralization of control within the DAO - (fewer individuals holding the same powers)

Given these risks, GovAlpha does not recommend that MKR Holders delegate to individuals that are members or facilitators of Core Units.

However, GovAlpha is aware that...
* ... exceptional individuals and circumstances may exist in which MKR Holders want to delegate to Core Unit members.
* ... no rule can be enforced here due to the permissionless nature of the delegate contracts.

We leave it to MKR token holders to judge when and if it is appropriate for them to delegate to members of Core Units.
