# Why to Become a Recognized Delegate at MakerDAO?

Individuals, or groups of individuals, that satisfy the [Recognized Delegate Requirements](https://manual.makerdao.com/governance/what-is-delegation/recognized-delegate-requirements) are eligible to become Recognized Delegates in MakerDAO.

The following are some of the benefits of becoming a Recognized Delegate in the Maker Protocol:

* Recognized Delegates are listed prominently on the voting portal compared to Shadow Delegates. This allows Recognized Delegates an advantage when attracting newly delegated MKR.
* Recognized Delegates are eligible for compensation from the Maker Protocol under [MIP61](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP61).
* Becoming a Recognized Delegate carries prestige as a prominent community member and a greater ability to influence DAO activity and proceedings in a way that aligns with the aims and ambitions of the Recognized Delegate.
* Recognized Delegates who are also MKR holders may feel they can improve the value of their holdings by acting in ways which they feel lead to protocol and revenue growth.
* Good performance as a Recognized Delegate in MakerDAO could afford opportunities for delegation in other protocols.
